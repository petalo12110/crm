## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 20+ | https://nodejs.org |
| pnpm | 9+ | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| Docker or Podman | Any recent | https://docs.docker.com/get-docker |

Verify:
```bash
node --version    # v20.x.x or higher
pnpm --version    # 9.x.x or higher
docker --version  # any version
```

---

## Installation

### 1. Extract the project
```bash
tar xzf crm-platform-full.tar.gz
cd crm-platform
```

### 2. Allow pnpm build scripts (required — do this once)

pnpm blocks native build scripts by default. Fix it permanently:

```bash
cat >> pnpm-workspace.yaml << 'EOF'

onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - '@prisma/client'
  - '@prisma/engines'
  - prisma
  - esbuild
  - msgpackr-extract
EOF
```

### 3. Install all dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Start the database and Redis
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL** on port 5432
- **Redis** on port 6379
- **Mailpit** on ports 1025 (SMTP) and 8025 (web UI — view sent emails here)

### 5. Configure environment
```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

Open `apps/api/.env` and set:
```env
JWT_SECRET=pick-any-random-string-at-least-32-characters
```

Everything else works with defaults for local development.

### 6. Set up the database
```bash
cd apps/api

# Generate Prisma client (required after install and after schema changes)
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma

# Create all database tables
npx prisma migrate dev --schema=prisma/schema.prisma --name init

# Load sample data (test company, users, customers, leads, tickets, tasks)
npx tsx src/prisma/seed.ts

cd ../..
```

You should see:
```
🎉  Seed complete!
📋  Test accounts (password for all: Admin@12345):
   superadmin@crm.local     — Super Admin
   owner@acme.example.com   — Company Owner
   manager@acme.example.com — Manager
   sales1@acme.example.com  — Sales Rep
   support@acme.example.com — Support
```

---

## Running the App

Open **two terminals**.

**Terminal 1 — API (port 3000):**
```bash
cd crm-platform
pnpm --filter api dev
```

Wait for: `info: CRM API running on port 3000`

**Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 5173):**
```bash
cd crm-platform
pnpm --filter web dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

---

## First Login

The login page asks for three things:

1. **Company ID** — the UUID of your company
2. **Email** — your account email
3. **Password** — your password

**Get your Company ID:**
```bash
cd crm-platform
docker compose exec postgres psql -U crm -d crm_dev -c "SELECT id, name FROM companies;"
```

Copy the UUID shown next to "Acme Corp".

**Test accounts** (password for all: `Admin@12345`):

| Email | Role |
|---|---|
| `owner@acme.example.com` | Company Owner — full access |
| `manager@acme.example.com` | Manager — manage customers, leads, team |
| `sales1@acme.example.com` | Sales Rep — manage own leads |
| `support@acme.example.com` | Support — handle tickets |

---

## How to Add Companies

Only the **Super Admin** (`superadmin@crm.local`) can create companies.

### Step 1 — Get a Super Admin token

First, get any company ID (even Acme Corp's ID works for Super Admin login):
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Company-ID: YOUR_ACME_COMPANY_ID" \
  -d '{"email":"superadmin@crm.local","password":"Admin@12345"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['accessToken'])")

echo "Token: $TOKEN"
```

### Step 2 — Create the company

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/companies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name":     "Beta Industries",
    "email":    "admin@beta.com",
    "phone":    "+260977000001",
    "country":  "ZM",
    "timezone": "Africa/Lusaka",
    "currency": "ZMW"
  }'
```

The response includes the new company's `id`. Save it — you need it to invite users.

### Step 3 — Invite the first Owner for that company

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/companies/NEW_COMPANY_ID/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "email":     "owner@beta.com",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName":  "Smith",
    "role":      "COMPANY_OWNER"
  }'
```

Jane can now log in with Company ID = new company's UUID, email = `owner@beta.com`, password = `Admin@12345`.

---

## How to Add Employees

**Company Owners** and **Super Admins** can invite employees.

### Using curl

```bash
# Log in as Owner first and get token (same as above)

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/companies/YOUR_COMPANY_ID/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OWNER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "email":      "alice@company.com",
    "firstName":  "Alice",
    "lastName":   "Phiri",
    "role":       "SALES_REP",
    "department": "Sales",
    "jobTitle":   "Account Executive"
  }'
```

**Available roles:** `MANAGER` · `SALES_REP` · `SUPPORT` · `EMPLOYEE`

The new employee logs in with:
- Company ID: your company's UUID
- Email: `alice@company.com`
- Password: `Admin@12345` (they should change this on first login via the profile menu → Change password)

### Using Postman

1. Open Postman and create a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login`
2. Add header: `X-Company-ID: your-company-uuid`
3. Set body (JSON): `{"email":"owner@acme.example.com","password":"Admin@12345"}`
4. Send and copy the `accessToken` from the response
5. Create a new `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/companies/:id/members`
6. Add header: `Authorization: Bearer <paste token>`
7. Set body (JSON) with the employee details and send

---

## How to Add Customers

Any **Manager or Sales Rep** can add customers.

### In the UI:
1. Click **Customers** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **+ New Customer** button (top right)
3. Fill in the form — name, email, phone, company, status, tags
4. Click **Save customer**

### Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "firstName":   "John",
    "lastName":    "Banda",
    "email":       "john@banda.zm",
    "phone":       "+260971234567",
    "companyName": "Banda Enterprises",
    "industry":    "Retail",
    "status":      "ACTIVE",
    "customerType":"BUSINESS",
    "country":     "ZM",
    "city":        "Lusaka",
    "tags":        ["vip", "wholesale"],
    "notes":       "Met at trade fair"
  }'
```

## Environment Variables

File: `apps/api/.env`  (copy from `apps/api/.env.example`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | (required) | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | (required) | Redis URL |
| `JWT_SECRET` | (required) | Min 32 chars — sign access tokens |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | optional | 64 hex chars — encrypts sensitive DB fields |
| `PORT` | `3000` | API server port |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `development` or `production` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | For CORS and email links |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | `local` | `local` or `s3` |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `localhost` | Email server host |

openssl rand -hex 32
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### API won't start — "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379"
Redis isn't running. Fix:
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps    # verify redis shows as "running"
```

### "Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'"
Prisma client not generated. Fix:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma
```

### "Unique constraint failed on ticket_number" during seed
Seed ran twice (once automatically by migrate, once manually). The data is already there. Just skip the manual seed. To start fresh:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma migrate reset --schema=prisma/schema.prisma
# Answer "yes" — this wipes and re-seeds automatically
```

### Login fails — "Not a member of this company"
Wrong Company ID. Get the correct one:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U crm -d crm_dev -c "SELECT id, name FROM companies;"
```

### pnpm install fails — ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS
Add the build allowlist to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
```bash
cat >> pnpm-workspace.yaml << 'EOF'

onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - '@prisma/client'
  - '@prisma/engines'
  - prisma
  - esbuild
  - msgpackr-extract
EOF
pnpm install
```

### Calendar event or task fails on save
Always select both **date AND time** in datetime fields. The input format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`. Submitting without a time selected causes a validation error.

### View outgoing emails
All emails in development are captured by Mailpit. Open **http://localhost:8025** to see them (password resets, notifications, etc.).

### Schema drift error on `prisma migrate dev`
If you see "Drift detected", Prisma found a mismatch between your migration files and the database. This happens when you switch between git branches or re-install. Answer **yes** to reset — it will re-run all migrations and re-seed.

---

## Deployment

Deployment (Render) is intentionally not wired up while this is still in
active local development — `render.yaml` exists as a ready-to-use
template for when you are ready, but two things need to be done by hand
first, since neither can be generated without a real database connection
or real provider credentials.

### 1. Generate the baseline migration

`prisma/migrations/` starts empty in this template. Before your first
deploy, generate one migration that captures your current schema, against
your local dev database (needs `docker compose up -d` running):

```bash
cd apps/api
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/0_init
npx prisma migrate diff \
  --from-empty \
  --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
  --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
```

Commit that file. `prisma migrate deploy` (Render's start command) will
apply it cleanly to any empty database — including your production one
on first deploy.

### 2. Set up real SMTP credentials

Password resets and new-employee invites both depend on outbound email —
without this, the account gets created but the person has no way to log
in (see `EmailProvider` — accounts are given a random, unusable password
on purpose; the "set your password" link is the *only* way in). Pick a
provider (Resend, SendGrid, and Mailgun all have workable free tiers),
then set these directly in Render's dashboard (**Environment** tab, never
in this repo):

```
SMTP_HOST=<provider's smtp host>
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=<provider's smtp username>
SMTP_PASS=<provider's smtp password or API key>
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Deploy

Push to your connected repo — Render picks up `render.yaml` automatically
(Blueprint). `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and the SMTP
vars above are all `sync: false` in the blueprint, meaning Render will
prompt you for real values on first deploy rather than defaulting to
blank. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET` come from a linked env var group
— generate them with `openssl rand -hex 32` and `openssl rand -base64 32`
respectively, and set them there.

### 4. Create your first Super Admin

Nothing seeds a real account into production automatically — the demo
seed script (`pnpm seed`) is dev-only and creates fake company/customer
data you don't want in production. Instead, once the first deploy is
live, run the dedicated bootstrap script once via Render's **Shell** tab
(so it runs against your real `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com \
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD='a-real-strong-password' \
SUPERADMIN_FIRST_NAME=Your \
SUPERADMIN_LAST_NAME=Name \
pnpm --filter api exec tsx src/prisma/bootstrap-admin.ts
```

It's idempotent — safe to re-run, it just reports if that account already
exists rather than erroring or duplicating it. Log in at
`POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login` (no Company ID needed for Super Admin).

### Scaling tips

| Need | Solution |
|---|---|
| More API capacity | Render's paid plans support multiple instances — but see the `WEB_CONCURRENCY=1` note in `render.yaml` first, since the BullMQ worker runs embedded in this process on the free tier |
| Managed database | `DATABASE_URL` already points at Neon by convention here — Supabase or AWS RDS work the same way |
| File uploads to cloud | `@aws-sdk/client-s3` is already a dependency — set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` and the matching `S3_*` vars |
| Better email delivery | Any real SMTP provider works — see step 2 above |
